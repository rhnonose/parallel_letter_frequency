# Parallel Letter Frequency

Write a program that counts the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done
sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a
list of texts and that employs parallelism.


Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ mix test
```
